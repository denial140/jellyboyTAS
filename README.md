# Jelly Boy TAS

## input_files
input_files stores an input file for each potential strategy used in a stage. They are organised into subfolders by world.

The folder for each world contains a folder for each level in the world, and a markdown file *_filenames.md explaining the naming convention for the input files in that world.

## maps
maps stores a map of each level in the game. They are organised into subfolders by world.

They do not yet contain information about the enemy spawns, or other sprites such as extra lives or item boxes. It is hoped that this will be added in the future.
